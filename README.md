# Angular 2 Todo App

<img src=./screenshots/ToDo.png />

- Built based off the SitePoint tutorial for creating a CRUD app with Angular 2. 

- Updated and migrated from the older version of Angular 2 used in the tutorial to the newest 1.01 version that now uses web pack. 

- The project also utilizes my own styling since none was provided in the tutorial. 

- Create new Todos to build up a list, cross them off as completed, and delete selected items or the whole list.
